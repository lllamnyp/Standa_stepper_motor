This is a MSVS 2017 project. It requires the [ximc library](https://en.xisupport.com/projects/enxisupport/wiki/Software); in particular, the `ximc.h` file should be located at `../../ximc/ximc.h` relative to the MSVS project and the directories `win32`/`win64` with the necessary dll's should also be in the same location.
